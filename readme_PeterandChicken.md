HOW THE GAME IS DESIGNED TO WORK.

Players choose a character.
Players pick an attack by clicking the choice of attack.
The attack will reduce the opponents health points by a random number 1 - 10. 
The scores will reflect in the green input buttons under characters.
When a character runs out of health points, the winner's name will appear in the H2 tag.
The "PLAY" button refreshes the page.

If I get to it...
Either a video snippet or image will show up in the DIV in between the characters when an attack is chosen. 


NOTES FOR MIKE
I am happy to have finished what I did, because I only asked for help once (not including the info about YouTube API) and it doesn't show any errors. However, on the flip side of the coin, I wish it worked as I have intended.
